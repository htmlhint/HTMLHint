import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Id and class value must meet some rules: underline, dash, hump.

Level: <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" />

## Config value

- `underline`: underline mode ( aaa_bb )
- `dash`: enable rule ( aaa-bbb )
- `hump`: enable rule ( aaaBbb )
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations

```html
underline: <div id="aaa_bbb">
dash: <div id="aaa-bbb">
hump: <div id="aaaBbb">

```
