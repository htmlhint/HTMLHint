Id and class value must meet some rules: underline, dash, hump.

Level: <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" />

## Config value

1. underline: underline mode ( aaa_bb )
2. dash: enable rule ( aaa-bbb )
3. hump: enable rule ( aaaBbb )
4. false: disable rule


### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations:

```html
underline: <div id="aaa_bbb">
dash: <div id="aaa-bbb">
hump: <div id="aaaBbb">

```
