import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The method attribute of a `<form>` element must be present with a valid value: "get", "post", or "dialog".

Level: <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations

```html
<form method="get"></form>
<form method="post"></form>
<form method="dialog"></form>
```

### The following patterns are considered rule violations

```html
<form>No method specified</form>
<form method="invalid">Invalid method</form>
```

## Why this rule is important

The absence of the method attribute means the form will use the default `GET` method. With `GET`, form data is included in the URL (e.g., `?username=john&password=secret`), which can expose sensitive information in browser history, logs, or the network request.

The HTML specification requires that form elements have one of three valid methods:

- `get`: Appends form data to the URL (default, but not recommended for sensitive data)
- `post`: Sends form data in the request body (more secure for sensitive data)
- `dialog`: Used for dialog forms (HTML5 feature)

This rule helps ensure that forms have explicit, valid methods for better security and user experience.
