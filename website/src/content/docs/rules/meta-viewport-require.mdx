import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A `<meta name="viewport">` must be present in `<head>` tag.

Level: <Badge text="Error" variant="danger" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations

```html
<html><head><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"></head></html>
```

### The following patterns are considered rule violations

```html
<!-- Missing meta viewport -->
<html><head></head></html>

<!-- Empty meta viewport content -->
<html><head><meta name="viewport" content=""></head></html>

<!-- Whitespace-only meta viewport content -->
<html><head><meta name="viewport" content=" "></head></html>
```

## Why this rule is important

The `<meta name="viewport">` tag is used to control the viewport of the page, which helps with responsive design.
