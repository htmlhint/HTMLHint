import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Alt of `img` must be present and alt of `area[href]` and `input[type=image]` must be set with a value.

Level: <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations

```html
<img src="test.png" alt="test" />
<input type="image" alt="test" />
<area shape="circle" coords="180,139,14" href="test.html" alt="test" />
```

### The following patterns are considered rule violations

```html
<img src="test.png" />
<input type="image" />
<area shape="circle" coords="180,139,14" href="test.html" />
```

### Why this rule is important

The alt attribute is used to provide alternative text for images, which helps improve accessibility for users who cannot see the image. It also helps with SEO by providing context for the image.
