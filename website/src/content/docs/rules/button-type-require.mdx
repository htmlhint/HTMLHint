import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The type attribute of a `<button>` element must be present with a valid value: "button", "submit", or "reset".

Level: <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations:

```html
<button type="button">Click me</button>
<button type="submit">Submit form</button>
<button type="reset">Reset form</button>
```

### The following patterns are considered rule violations:

```html
<button>No type specified</button>
<button type="invalid">Invalid type</button>
```

## Why this rule is important

HTML buttons default to `type="submit"` when used within a form if no type is specified, which can lead to unexpected form submissions. Explicitly setting the type attribute makes the button's behavior predictable and clear to both developers and users.

The HTML specification requires that button elements have one of three valid types:

- `button`: A generic button with no default behavior
- `submit`: Submits the form data to the server (default)
- `reset`: Resets all form controls to their initial values

This rule helps ensure that buttons have explicit, valid types for better browser compatibility and user experience.
