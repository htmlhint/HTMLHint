import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Inline style cannot be used.

Level: <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following pattern is considered a rule violation:

```html
<div style="color:red"></div>
```

## Why this rule is important

Inline styles can make the code harder to read and maintain. They also make it harder to override styles with CSS.
