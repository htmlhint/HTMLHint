import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tagname must be lowercase.

Level: <Badge text="Error" variant="danger" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule
- `['clipPath', 'data-Test']`: enable rule except for the given tag names. All SVG camelCase elements are included, for example `linearGradient`, `foreignObject`

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations

```html
<span><div>
```

SVG elements with camelCase names (e.g. `linearGradient`, `foreignObject`) are allowed:

```html
<svg><linearGradient /><foreignObject /><textPath /></svg>
```

### The following pattern is considered a rule violation:

```html
<SPAN><BR>
```

### Why this rule is important

Lowercase tagnames typically have higher compression rates compared to uppercase tagnames allowing for slightly faster page loads.
Lowercase tagnames are also more readable and easier to understand.
