import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Special characters must be escaped.

Level: <Badge text="Error" variant="danger" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered violations

```html
<span>aaa&gt;bbb&lt;ccc</span>
<span>Steinway &amp; Sons, Q&amp;A</span>
<span>Steinway & Sons, Q&A</span>
```

### The following pattern is considered a rule violation:

```html
<span>aaa>bbb<ccc</span>
```

## Why this rule is important

Special HTML characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` must be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML tags or entities. This avoids rendering issues and potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
