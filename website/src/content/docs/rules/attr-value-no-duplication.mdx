import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Attribute values should not contain duplicates.

Level: <Badge text="Error" variant="danger" />

## Config value

- `true`: enable rule
- `false`: disable rule

### The following patterns are **not** considered rule violations

```html
<div class="container fluid small">Content</div>
```

```html
<span data-toggle="modal">Content</span>
```

```html
<div class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Button</div>
```

```html
<source type="" sizes="(min-width: 1rem) 1vw, (min-width: 2rem) 2vw" srcset="">
```

## Excluded attributes

The following attributes are excluded from this rule and will not trigger errors even if they contain duplicate values:

- `content` - Common for meta tags that may contain duplicate keywords
- `d` - Used in SVG path data which may contain repetitive pattern data
- `media` - Used for media queries which have special parsing rules
- `on*` - All event handlers (onclick, onkeydown, etc.) that may contain legitimate duplicate JavaScript operations
- `sizes` - Used in responsive images with complex viewport conditions
- `src` - URLs and data URIs that might legitimately contain repeated patterns
- `style` - Inline CSS which has its own syntax and may contain duplicate property names

### The following patterns are considered rule violations:

```html
<div class="d-none small d-none">Content</div>
```

```html
<span data-attributes="dark light dark">Content</span>
```

```html
<div class="btn  primary btn">Button</div>
```

## Why does this rule exist?

Having duplicate values in attributes like `class` or custom data attributes can:

- Make the markup unnecessarily verbose
- Cause confusion during development
- Lead to inefficient CSS specificity calculations
- Indicate potential copy-paste errors or oversight

This rule helps maintain clean, efficient markup by catching these duplicates early.
